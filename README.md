# Peridotite
<sup>pronounced pear‧id (as in rid)‧uh‧tite (as in tights)</sup>  
A compiler from Facet to JavaScript, with optional Flow type annotations used for type-checking.

## ROADMAP
### 0.1.0
* Fix function arguments
* Emit Flow type annotation comments
* (Maybe) enclose Flow constructs in `/* ::`*`code`*`*/`
* Write spec for Facet (may be moved to 0.2.0)
